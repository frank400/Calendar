# Calendar
A simple google calendar API script that prints all my tasks for the day.
to execute it you only need to write on your terminal the following comand line:

python3 calendar.py

at the first time,you will need to authorize the app to acess your google calendar.

OBS:I used portuguese to a little part of the project since im Brazilian.
